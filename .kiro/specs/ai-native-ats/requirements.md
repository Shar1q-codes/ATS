# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building an AI-native Applicant Tracking System (ATS) that handles per-company role variations without duplicating job posts, offers explainable AI matching with transparent fit scores, and is designed to be CRM-ready for future expansion. The system targets SMBs, startups (<100 employees), and recruitment agencies as the primary market.
