# Authentication System Fixes - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current authentication system has several critical issues preventing users from successfully registering and logging into the AI-Native ATS platform. This document outlines the requirements to fix the authentication flow and ensure a smooth user onboarding experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Registration API Integration

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to successfully register for an account so that I can access the ATS platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits the registration form THEN the frontend SHALL send the correct data structure to the backend API
2. WHEN the backend receives registration data THEN it SHALL validate all required fields according to the DTO schema
3. WHEN registration is successful THEN the system SHALL return proper authentication tokens and user data
4. WHEN registration fails THEN the system SHALL return clear error messages to help users resolve issues
5. IF a user already exists THEN the system SHALL return a specific error message indicating the email is already registered

### Requirement 2: Fix Data Structure Mismatches

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent data structures between frontend and backend so that API calls work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend sends registration data THEN it SHALL match the backend RegisterDto structure exactly
2. WHEN the backend returns authentication responses THEN they SHALL match the frontend AuthResponse interface
3. WHEN token refresh occurs THEN the request/response structure SHALL be consistent between frontend and backend
4. WHEN API errors occur THEN they SHALL follow a consistent error response format

### Requirement 3: Fix Missing UI Components

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper error handling and feedback so that I understand what's happening during registration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN registration fails THEN the user SHALL see clear error messages
2. WHEN the form is submitting THEN the user SHALL see loading indicators
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the user SHALL see field-specific error messages
4. WHEN the system is unavailable THEN the user SHALL see appropriate error handling

### Requirement 4: Fix Organization Creation Flow

**User Story:** As a new user registering for the first time, I want an organization to be automatically created so that I can start using the platform immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user registers THEN the system SHALL automatically create an organization for them
2. WHEN an organization is created THEN the user SHALL be assigned as the admin of that organization
3. WHEN organization creation fails THEN the registration SHALL fail gracefully with appropriate error messages
4. WHEN a user provides a company name THEN it SHALL be used as the organization name

### Requirement 5: Fix Authentication Token Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication session to work properly so that I stay logged in and can access protected features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully registers THEN they SHALL receive valid access and refresh tokens
2. WHEN tokens are stored THEN they SHALL persist across browser sessions
3. WHEN tokens expire THEN they SHALL be automatically refreshed without user intervention
4. WHEN token refresh fails THEN the user SHALL be redirected to login with appropriate messaging

### Requirement 6: Fix Backend API Endpoints

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want properly implemented API endpoints so that authentication requests work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the /auth/register endpoint is called THEN it SHALL properly handle all registration fields
2. WHEN the /auth/login endpoint is called THEN it SHALL return consistent response format
3. WHEN the /auth/refresh endpoint is called THEN it SHALL accept the correct request format
4. WHEN authentication endpoints fail THEN they SHALL return proper HTTP status codes and error messages

### Requirement 7: Fix Environment Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper environment configuration so that the frontend can communicate with the backend correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the frontend SHALL use the correct backend API URL
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN they SHALL include proper headers and authentication
3. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
4. WHEN in development mode THEN CORS SHALL be properly configured to allow frontend-backend communication
